    ex:hasDesignOfPublishing "Nonrandomized clinical trial" ;
    ex:hasObjective "To examine the feasibility of ED vestibular rehabilitation therapy (ED-VeRT) using a protocolized diagnostic classification algorithm and collection of longitudinal patient-reported outcomes." ;

    ex:hasDescription "Participants received either the ED-VeRT intervention or usual care based on physician discretion. ED-VeRT was delivered by ED physical therapists using a standardized diagnostic and treatment algorithm." .

ex:PrimaryOutcomeAnalysis ex:hasDescription "Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to analyze primary outcome of Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores over 3 months, adjusting for study arm, baseline score, time, interaction terms, age, and gender." .

ex:AdditionalAnalysis ex:hasDescription "Exploratory subgroup analyses based on age and symptom duration; sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting." .

ex:MissingDataHandling ex:hasDescription "Multiple imputation (m=40) was used for missing follow-up data, combined with inverse probability weighting in sensitivity analysis." .

ex:StatisticalSoftware ex:hasDescription "All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.4." .

ex:MethodToAssignUnits ex:hasDescription "Participants were assigned to treatment arms (ED-VeRT or usual care) at the discretion of the treating physician." .

ex:UnitOfAssignment ex:hasDescription "Individual patient level." .

ex:Restrictions ex:hasDescription "No formal restrictions such as blocking or stratification were applied." .

ex:BiasMinimizationMethod ex:hasDescription "Baseline differences were adjusted for in models; the study design acknowledges limitations due to nonrandom assignment." .

ex:QualityEnhancingMethods ex:hasDescription "Use of validated outcome instruments (DHI, VAAI-9)." .

ex:DataCollectingMethods ex:hasDescription "Structured REDCap surveys at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post-visit." .

ex:intervention001 a ex:Interventions ;
    ex:hasContent "ED-VeRT intervention consisting of evaluation and treatment based on diagnostic algorithm (e.g., Epley maneuver, glucocorticoids), education, and referral." ;
