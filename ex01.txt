# Method Descriptions
ex:PrimaryOutcomeAnalysis ex:hasDescription "Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to model change in NSSI frequency (DSHI-9) across pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3-, and 6-month follow-up."^^xsd:string .
ex:AdditionalAnalysis ex:hasDescription "Subgroup and mediation analyses explored whether improvements in emotion regulation mediated changes in NSSI and self-destructive behaviors."^^xsd:string .
ex:MissingDataHandling ex:hasDescription "Regression weights inversely related to the probability of value observation were used under the assumption of data missing at random."^^xsd:string .
ex:StatisticalSoftware ex:hasDescription "Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.1."^^xsd:string .
ex:MethodToAssignUnits ex:hasDescription "No assignment to different conditions; this was an uncontrolled open trial."^^xsd:string .
ex:UnitOfAssignment ex:hasDescription "Individual adolescent"^^xsd:string .
ex:Restrictions ex:hasDescription "Not applicable due to lack of condition assignment."^^xsd:string .
ex:BiasMinimizationMethod ex:hasDescription "No randomization; selection bias potentially mitigated by inclusion criteria and reporting per TREND guidelines."^^xsd:string .
ex:MethodsToAccountVariance ex:hasDescription "Not applicable; unit of analysis matches unit of assignment (individual adolescent)."^^xsd:string .
ex:RecruitmentMethods ex:hasDescription "Participants were self-referred or referred from CAMHS via emails, internal website, newspaper ads, social media, and national website."^^xsd:string .
ex:SamplingMethods ex:hasDescription "No systematic sampling plan; convenience sample based on eligibility screening."^^xsd:string .
ex:QualityEnhancingMethods ex:hasDescription "Validated instruments (e.g., DSHI-9, DERS) used; high internal consistency for all outcome measures."^^xsd:string .
ex:DataCollectingMethods ex:hasDescription "Weekly and periodic online self-report measures and clinician-rated interviews; some assessments conducted via phone or in person."^^xsd:string .
ex:InterventionDeliveryMethods ex:hasDescription "Delivered entirely online via secure web platform and mobile app; weekly modules with asynchronous psychologist feedback."^^xsd:string .
